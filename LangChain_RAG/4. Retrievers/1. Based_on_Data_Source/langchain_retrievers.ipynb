      " Karnal Sher Khan (1 January 1970 – 5 July 1999) was a Pakistani military officer. He is one of only eleven recipients of Pakistan's highest military gallantry award, Nishan-e-Haider. He was a captain in the 27th Sindh Regiment of the Pakistan Army and later was posted to 12th NLI Regiment during the Kargil War. He was killed in action during the war. For his bravery during the Kargil War, he was awarded the Nishan-e-Haider. His name is the localised form of the rank Colonel.\n",

His father's name was Hazar Khan. He was the youngest of two brothers and two sisters and his mother died when he was 6 years old which left him to be raised by his father. \n",

Indian Army launched eight attacks on their position to reclaim the strategic posts. However, Khan and his men were able to defend those posts. On 5 July 1999, the Indian army launched another attack and surrounded his posts with two battalions. With heavy mortar fire, the Indian Army captured one of his posts. Khan personally led a successful counter-attack and was able to re-capture the occupied lost post. Despite shortage of ammunition and men, Khan was successful in forcing the enemy to retreat. However, during the battle he was hit by machine gun fire and was killed in action.\n",
      "Indian Army Brigadier M. P. S. Bajwa was impressed by the actions of Captain Khan and wrote to the government of Pakistan citing the bravery of the young officer.

It also serves as a route for traffic coming from Punjab and Azad Kashmir going towards Taxila, Attock, and onwards to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is named IJ Principle Road because it is the road that was going to be between the never-built Sector J and Sector I of Islamabad.\n",

Four firms responded to the tender: Zeerak International, National Engineering Services Pakistan (NESPAK), EA Associates, and ACC Consultants, out of which the former was hired in April 2020. It presented its plan in October 2020, which had an estimated cost of Rs. 5.322 billion.   \n",
      "In 2021, the government launched a plan to rebuild and widen the dual carriageway by adding two additional lanes on either side at a cost of Rs. 4.9 billion, while Rs. 120 million was earmarked for environmental protection and conservation. The renovation project also envisaged two flyovers, two bridges (at Katarian and Pirwadhai), and seven culverts as well. The National Logistics Cell was awarded the contract for the project.

      " The Battle of Karnal (Persian: نبرد کرنال) (24 February 1739) was a decisive victory for Nader Shah, the founder of the Afsharid dynasty of Iran, during his invasion of India. Nader's forces defeated the army of Muhammad Shah within three hours, paving the way for the Iranian sack of Delhi. The engagement is considered the crowning jewel in Nader's military career as well as a tactical masterpiece. The battle took place near Karnal in Haryana, 110 kilometres (68 mi) north of Delhi, India. As a result of the overwhelming defeat of the Mughal Empire at Karnal, the already-declining Mughal dynasty was critically weakened to such an extent as to hasten its demise. According to Axworthy, it is also possible that without the ruinous effects of Nader's invasion of India, European colonial takeover of the Indian subcontinent would have come in a different form or perhaps not at all.\n",

      "The events at the Delhi court during Nadir’s invasion reveal a story of shocking inefficiency. News of Kabul’s loss in June 1738 reached Delhi in early July, yet nothing was done to secure the borders for many months. Even after Nadir Shah crossed the Khyber Pass in November, it was two months before any decisive action was taken. On 2 December 1738, the Emperor officially permitted his three top nobles—Itimad-ad-Daula, Qamar-ud-Din Khan (the wazir), Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I (the regent), and Samsam‑ud‑daulah Khan Dauran (the military head)—to move against the invader and provided them with funds. Instead of promptly addressing the threat, however, they set up camp outside Delhi in the Shalimar Garden near Sarai Baoli and wasted an entire month.\n",
      "When news came on 10 January 1739 that Nadir Shah had crossed the river at Attock, the imperial army was finally urged to act. The court still placed its hopes on Governor Zakariya Khan to make a stand, but when he proved unable to resist Nadir Shah, some courtiers even accused him of treachery—alleging that he had surrendered Lahore fort to the Persians because of his shared background with Nadir.\n",
      "At the first sign of Nadir Shah’s advance, the court recognised its own shortcomings and called on the experienced Nizam for advice. A veteran of Aurangzeb’s era, the Nizam was known for his wisdom and diplomacy, yet he was not given full command or the confidence of the Emperor, whose trust lay with Khan Dauran and the local faction. Khan Dauran, who admired Rajput bravery, even sent messengers to call on his protégés among the Hindu Rajputs, especially Sawai Jai Singh, to aid the Emperor. However, longstanding alienation had left the Rajput chieftains reluctant to act, with many now seeking independence and even inviting the Marathas to help dismantle the Empire. The Emperor eventually appealed to Baji Rao for help, and the Peshwa promised to send the Malwa force under leaders such as Malhar Rao Holkar, Ranuji Sindhia, and Udaji Puar. Nevertheless, this expected assistance never arrived in time. Not only did no Dakhini force come to aid at Karnal, but the Maratha envoy even fled, and Baji Rao later considered defending the Narmada line to block further advances by Nadir. A coordinated Maratha defence of northern India simply did not happen.\n",
      "The imperial forces spent the month of Ramzan (December 1738) outside Delhi without any significant action. Once it was confirmed that the Persians had crossed at Attock, the three nobles finally began marching toward Lahore on 10 January 1739, urging the Emperor to join them immediately. Soon after, they reached Panipat, where on that same day Muhammad Shah left Delhi and later joined his generals who had been waiting. By that time, news of Nadir’s capture of Lahore had already reached the court, making it impossible to save the city. It was then decided to set up camp and await the enemy at Karnal, a location with abundant water from a canal and open plains suitable for manoeuvring large cavalry units. This pause also allowed time for...\n"
